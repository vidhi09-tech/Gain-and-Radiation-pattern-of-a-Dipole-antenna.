## OBJECTIVE
 •	Generate radiation pattern
 
 •	Generate pattern Elevation
 
 •	Generate pattern Azimuth
 

Antenna gain is the ability of the antenna to radiate more or less in any direction compared to a theoretical antenna. If an antenna could be made as a perfect sphere, it would radiate equally in all directions. Such an antenna is theoretically called an isotropic antenna and does not in fact exist.
When mounted horizontally, the radiation peaks at right angles (90°) to the conductor, with nulls in the direction of the dipole. Neglecting electrical inefficiency, the antenna gain is equal to the directive gain, which is 1.5 (1.76 dBi) for a short dipole, increasing to 1.64 (2.15 dBi) for a half-wave dipole.
The gain of an antenna G = Antenna efficiency * Antenna directivity D. Units for Gain – dB (decibels), dBi (decibels relative to an isotropic antenna), dBd (decibels relative to dipole antenna)
 
 
Dipoles are frequently used as resonant antennas. The radiation pattern of the half-wave dipole is maximum perpendicular to the conductor, falling to zero in the axial direction, thus implementing an omnidirectional antenna if installed vertically, or (more commonly) a weakly directional antenna if horizontal.
The radiation pattern is defined as a mathematical function or a graphical representation of the far field (ie, for r≫2D2/λ, with D being the largest dimension of the antenna) radiation properties of the antenna, as a function of the direction of departure of the electromagnetic (EM) wave.
The dipole antenna is one type of transducer which converts electrical signals into RF electromagnetic waves and radiates them at the transmitting side and converts RF electromagnetic waves into electrical signals at the receiving side.
